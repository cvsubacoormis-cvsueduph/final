This is a customized Next.js project for the Cavite State University Bacoor City Campus Student Portal.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn install && yarn dev
# or
pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result. After signing in, you'll be redirected based on your role (admin or student).

You can start editing any page under the `app` directoryâ€”for example, the sign-in page at `app/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx`. The app auto-updates as you edit files.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing-fonts) to automatically optimize and load local Geist fonts defined in `app/layout.tsx`.
